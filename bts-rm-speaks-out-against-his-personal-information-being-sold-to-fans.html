Member of arguably the most popular boy band of all time, BTS‚Äô leader and rapper RM publicly condemned the attitude of a train employee who sold his ticket information over the course of three years.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=585 data-current-count=585 data-injectable=true>Using his personal <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram account</a>, RM posted a story containing a news piece regarding a Korail employee who had been leaking RM‚Äôs whereabouts for three years ‚Äì unbeknownst to the musician. Although RM only added a few emoticons as a response, this marks the second time the singer has had his personal information leaked by someone he should have been able to trust, after a monk sold information on the member‚Äôs future military enlistment following a visit to the temple. This is also the second time RM publicly mentions this type of information breach by a worker.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>[230302 RM Instagram Story]</p><p>üê® ^^;;</p><p>note: screenshot of the article is about an employee of Korail (train/railway company in korea) who accessed and shared rm‚Äôs personal information for 3 years <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/HF73noDWu4</a></p>‚Äî ÎØ∏ÎãàÏúµ üß∏ (@miiniyoongs) <a href=#>March 1, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=515 data-current-count=815 data-injectable=true>According to the news reported by <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">HuffingtonPost Korea</a>, the train station employee had been leaking information regarding RM‚Äôs tickets, allowing obsessive fans (also known as sasaengs) and reporters to purchase tickets next to or near the singer and dancer. This information leak lasted at least three years, and despite his gigantic popularity in and out of South Korea, the musician was always open about walking in his country nonchalantly, trusting fans and employees to remain respectful of his presence.</p><p data-characters=414 data-current-count=414 data-injectable=true>This marks the second location and information breach in 2023 alone. Back in January, following a visit to a monastery temple, BTS‚Äô RM sought advice from a monk, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">who later leaked their conversation to a reporter</a>. The visit was disclosed by the monk, as well as information regarding the member‚Äôs future mandatory conscription, and even his past charity work that had remained anonymous over the years.</p><p data-characters=397 data-current-count=397 data-injectable=false>Despite being open regarding their fear of trusting strangers, after years of being used even by their industry peers, BTS members have remained relatively cautious regarding who they let in their circle. In 2021, after Jason Derulo‚Äôs ‚ÄúSavage Love‚Äù collaboration remix with BTS, the singer openly admitted to wanting to collaborate with BTS <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">purely because of their large fanbase.</a></p><p data-characters=388 data-current-count=785 data-injectable=false>Considering the group‚Äôs popularity ‚Äî <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">which has yet to cease even after they‚Äôve announced their break</a> ‚Äî it is no wonder that people look at BTS as a business and economic opportunity. But at the end of the day, they are just people attempting to live their less-than-ordinary lives with as much normalcy and freedom as they can ‚Äì even if that freedom is clearly limited.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2Svtb%2BMq6Rmq6Carqy%2FjKisrWWRnK6qutKtZKGho2K9pr7SqKWapF2eu6e70aaYraGfo3qjscinnmarn6GxbsDOZp2apqNk</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./who-are-the-supporting-acts-joining-john-mayer-on-his-solo-tour.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>¬´&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who are the supporting acts joining John Mayer on his solo tour?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./bachelor-in-paradise-season-9-finale-where-the-couples-stand-now.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;¬ª</span><p class=pager__title>'Bachelor in Paradise' Season 9 Finale: Where the Couples Stand Now</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./annie-macaulay-idibia-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-258311-html.html>Annie Macaulay-Idibia Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biograp</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jjk-chapter-247-leaks.html>Yuji Killed Sukuna?!
