Fergus has noticed how he moves through Belfast, known to the IRA, unintimidated by the British troops. Both sides already think they know who he is.</p><p>Informing on the IRA was of course a nearly certain death sentence. It seems incredible that anyone would take such a risk, and very few did. McGartland’s information is credited with saving the lives of at least 50 men, and you’d think the IRA might have noticed parallels between their assassination operations and McGartland’s participation, but apparently not. Only at the end of the film is there a situation where his role will be betrayed, and by then, he already realizes that he will be living for the rest of his life in hiding.</p><p>The Troubles were a messy business. The British troops were acting under orders that not all of them necessarily appreciated. They were not fighting in a foreign land, but against those who spoke and lived much as they did. The Protestant-Catholic hatred involved also muddied the water. To step into the middle of this was almost a foolhardy act, and “Fifty Dead Men Walking” never really explains McGartland’s decision. Still, it is a fact that he made it, even with the risk to his girlfriend and their child.</p><p>The performance of Jim Sturgess as McGartland helps place his decision into the day-by-day process of acting on it. He meets clandestinely with Fergus, rises in the trust of the IRA, is able to use information he gets from Fergus to enhance his position. The two men become not friends, exactly, but mutually dependent, and as the net grows tighter toward the end, their dependence takes on an urgent desperation.</p><p>The writer and director is <a href=#>Kari Skogland</a>, a young Canadian whose previous film, “The Stone Angel” (2007), could not be more different. It stars <a href=#>Ellen Burstyn</a> as an old lady who runs away from the children who want to place her in a nursing home. In this film, Skogland, as <a href=#>Kathryn Bigelow</a> does in “<a href=#>The Hurt Locker</a>,” demolishes the notion that women can’t direct action.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46foJ%2BsqWKxpq3DZqSepl2srq23yKeeZmpgZYY%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./forget-superman-these-x-men-roles-are-perfect-for-henry-cavills-mcu-debut.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Forget Superman, these X-Men roles are perfect for Henry Cavills MCU debut</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./adrian-poole.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Adrian Poole, Author at We Got This Covered</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./annie-macaulay-idibia-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-258311-html.html>Annie Macaulay-Idibia Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biograp</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jjk-chapter-247-leaks.html>Yuji Killed Sukuna?!
