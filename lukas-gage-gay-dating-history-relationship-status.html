But this isn’t the reason we’re here today.</p><p>Given Lukas’s multiple on-screen gay roles, many are still quite confused if the actor is gay in real life! Furthermore, fans want to hear all about all the star’s dating history and current relationship status., which we’ll be discussing below!</p><h3><strong>Is Lukas Gage Gay?</strong></h3><p>No, Lukas Gage is not gay.</p><p>So, why did the actor have so many rumors about him being one? Well, it all started from the comments over socials — IG, TikTok, etc. One would just hint at how well he portrays the gender and the other would assume the former comment confirmed him as gay. And so on…</p><p>Also, the rumors have a lot to do with the fact that Lukas has so many gay roles including the one on <i>Tagged, Euphoria</i>, and <i>White Lotus</i>. And not to mention Lukas’ “shocking” gay s*x scene with Murray Bartlett on White Lotus, that didn’t help his case at all!</p><p>According to Murray, the two were just being “playful” on set, at the time.</p><p>With this being said, Lukas does support gay rights. He started his career after defending one of his gay friends. At age 18, Lukas and his friend were out partying when suddenly a bunch of guys beats up his friend for being gay. Naturally, Lukas jumped in to protect him, only to get beat up too.</p><p>“I broke my orbitals, my nose, my jaw … eight of my teeth got knocked out. I (had to get) my face put back together,” the actor recalled.</p><p>So, as he lay on a hospital bed, Lukas had this epiphany “If I die, will I have done everything I wanted to do?” He remembered that he was never happy in school and away wanted to pursue acting. And that was when the You star made up his mind to follow his dreams.</p><h3><strong>Lukas Gage Dating History</strong></h3><p>Lukas Gage has dated quite a few stars in the past.
