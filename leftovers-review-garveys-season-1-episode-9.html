At least at first, “The Garveys At Their Best” paints a picture of a relatively average, and certainly bearable, existence for everyone in town. Kevin and Laurie are still married; Jill is a brace-faced, David Guetta-loving teenager whose biggest problem is working on her science fair project; Tommy is still in touch with his parents; and the Guilty Remnant isn’t even a twinkle in Patti’s eye. Business as usual.</p><p data-characters=885 data-current-count=885 data-injectable=true>It’s only as the episode progresses that we begin to see cracks in the mask. For one, Kevin is unhappy in his marriage to Laurie. He at one point tells his father (still the venerated chief of police) that, “I think there’s something wrong with me.” As hard as he tries to make himself buy into the idea that he’s happy, Kevin simply isn’t. Something’s not right. He asks, “Why isn’t it enough?” Kevin Sr.’s reply is just to nut up and accept normality: “You have no greater purpose, because <i>it</i> is enough.” (Boy, the Sudden Departure certainly changed his tune.) That’s not enough for Kevin, though. He wants more. His tattoo-adorned back is evidence enough of that – this guy was once a free spirit with a full tank and real ambitions, and settling down has made him feel like a bird in a cage.</p><p data-characters=627 data-current-count=627 data-injectable=false>At the very least, he wants to be a hero, like his father. Perhaps that’s why he became a cop. At the very least, it’s definitely why he wants to tranquilize the deer rampaging through town and release it back into the wild instead of simply killing it. Of&nbsp;course he needs to save that deer –&nbsp;Kevin identifies strongly with the beast, feeling just as out of place in his marriage as that majestic creature does inside a kindergarten. To simply blow its brains out would be to subliminally suggest to himself that the marriage can’t be fixed, that&nbsp;he can’t be fixed. It would be to admit defeat.</p>Pages: <span class="post-page-numbers current" aria-current=page>1</span> <a href=# class=post-page-numbers>2</a> <a href=# class=post-page-numbers>3</a> <a href=# class=post-page-numbers>4</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3ytscWtpq%2Bdoqh6s7HVopywZZeWv7ex2KxkrJ2RqLyveZBmnKmho6SxpnmYaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./adam-sandler-open-to-mcu-fans-fantastic-idea-for-his-role.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Adam Sandler open to MCU and fans have Fantastic idea for his role</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./the-funeral-1996.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>The Funeral movie review &amp;amp; film summary (1996)</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./annie-macaulay-idibia-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-258311-html.html>Annie Macaulay-Idibia Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biograp</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jjk-chapter-247-leaks.html>Yuji Killed Sukuna?!
