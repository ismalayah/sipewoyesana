Afterwards, he swore that he would destroy the Alola League himself before leaving with his allies. Later, Guzma went to his room at the Shady House and punched the wall after recalling Professor Kukui asking him if he was running away from a challenge, as he had done in the past with the <a href=# title="Island challenge">island challenge</a> and <a href=# title="Island kahuna">island kahunas</a>.</p><p>In <a href=# title=SM128>SM128</a>, Guzma and Plumeria intervened in a confrontation Tupp, Rapp, and Zipp were having with Ash and <a href=# title="Ash's friends">his friends</a> at <a href=# title="Manalo Stadium">Manalo Stadium</a>. He was about to battle Ash's group, but Professor Kukui and <a href=# title=Hala>Hala</a> arrived. Guzma confronted Professor Kukui and revealed that he had enrolled as a contestant in the <a href=# title="Manalo Conference">Manalo Conference</a>; furthermore, he announced his intention to destroy Professor Kukui's dreams by becoming <a href=# title="Pokémon Champion">Champion</a> and then ensuring another Pokémon League would never take place in Alola.</p><p>After Guzma and his teammates left, Hala explained that in the past, both Guzma and Kukui were his apprentices, but Guzma grew disillusioned with Hala's teachings and rejected them both, instead resolving to become strong on his own without the need for a <a href=# title=Z-Ring>Z-Ring</a> or <a href=# title=Z-Crystal>Z-Crystals</a>. Later, Guzma and Plumeria were among the Trainers gathered at the party commemorating the Manalo Conference's opening. He grew angry upon seeing the celebratory mood of Professor Kukui and the other attendees, drawing Plumeria's concern.</p><p>In <a href=# title=SM129>SM129</a>, Guzma competed in the <a href=# title="Manalo Conference">Manalo Conference</a> with his <a href=# title="Scizor (Pokémon)">Scizor</a>. He was able to progress to the Top 16, although Plumeria and the other participating Team Skull Grunts were defeated. The match-ups revealed that he would be battling <a href=# title=Ilima>Ilima</a>.</p><p>In <a href=# title=SM130>SM130</a>, Guzma went up against Ilima, using his Scizor to battle Ilima's <a href=# title="Kangaskhan (Pokémon)">Kangaskhan</a>. Despite Ilima <a href=# title="Mega Evolution">Mega Evolving</a> Kangaskhan, Scizor was able to defeat its opponent by positioning itself so that Kangaskhan's baby was always in the middle, endangering its well-being and causing the mother to hesitate often enough to be defeated. This allowed Guzma to advance to the second round.</p><p>In <a href=# title=SM131>SM131</a>, it was revealed that <a href=# title="Lana (anime)">Lana</a> would be Guzma's opponent in the second round. In <a href=# title=SM134>SM134</a>, Guzma and Lana began their battle, with Guzma using Golisopod against <a href=# title="Lana's Primarina">Lana's Primarina</a>. With his ruthless tactics, Guzma was able to defeat Lana with relative ease and advance to the semifinals. The match-ups revealed that he would battling Ash in the semifinals. In <a href=# title=SM135>SM135</a>, Guzma assured his Grunts that he would destroy the entire League and brushed off Plumeria's concerns about him facing Ash.</p><p>Right after, in <a href=# title=SM136>SM136</a>, Guzma went up against Ash, using his Scizor to battle his <a href=# class=mw-redirect title="Ash's Torracat">Torracat</a>. He quickly recalled Scizor in favor of using Golisopod, only for Golisopod to activate Emergency Exit during the match and send Scizor out in its place, resulting in it being quickly defeated by <a href=# title="Fire Blast (move)">Fire Blast</a>. Angered by Golisopod's cowardice, Guzma sent it out again and berated it on having made Scizor lose.</p><p>The battle continued in <a href=# title=SM137>SM137</a>, during which Guzma finally started to realize his own cowardice through defeating only weak opponents and running away from battles against strong ones. Despite the strength of Ash's Pikachu, Golisopod still wanted to continue battling, but the battle ultimately led to Guzma's loss. The audience applauded for the great battle and Kukui hoped to see Guzma participating next year as well, but Guzma considered his reputation ruined and was ready to disband Team Skull. However, Plumeria and the Team Skull Grunts were so fired up by the battle that they wanted stay by his side and learn to battle as well as he did.</p><p>Guzma reappeared in a flashback in <a href=# title=SM138>SM138</a>.</p><h2><span class=mw-headline id=Character>Character</span></h2><a href=# class=image><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/thumb/e/e6/Guzma_trophies.png/345px-Guzma_trophies.png decoding=async width=230 height=129 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> Guzma's trophies<p>Guzma has a great amount of determination, which was best showcased during the <a href=# title="Manalo Conference">Manalo Conference</a>, where he entered with the strong hopes of destroying it from within.

Despite his brutality, he is a careful fighter who observes his opponents and adapts his Pokémon's next moves accordingly, both by not falling for the same tricks twice and by trying to find a weakness he can exploit. All of this is done with cold and calculating precision, with him taking full advantage of any chance that comes.</p><p>Guzma completely defied the use of Z-Rings and Z-Crystals because, in his youth, he never learned to understand them properly and was bitter for always losing exercise battles against Kukui, despite the latter always commending his growth as a Trainer. After resolving to become strong in his own, Guzma built his reputation among Team Skull as "the Undefeated" by actually defeating only weak Trainers and retreating from battles against stronger Trainers with an excuse that he would have won anyways due to the damage his brutal tactics would do to his opponents' Pokémon. It was only during his battle against Ash in the Manalo Conference when Guzma was finally forced to admit his own cowardice and Golisopod, who had previously shared the same personality traits as him, now convinced him to let go of his fear of losing and keep battling until the end.</p><h2><span id=Pok.C3.A9mon></span><span class=mw-headline id=Pokémon>Pokémon</span></h2><p>This listing is of Guzma's known <a href=# title="Pokémon (species)">Pokémon</a> in the <a href=# title="Pokémon anime">anime</a>:</p><table><tbody readability=1.5><tr readability=3><td><b>の</b></td><td><br><b>This article is missing information on this character's Japanese voice actor.</b><br>You can help by adding this information.</td></tr></tbody></table><table align=left width=100%><tbody readability=9.8908507223114><tr><td colspan=2 rowspan=2 width=25% align=center><a href=# class=image title="Guzma's Golisopod"><img alt="Guzma's Golisopod" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/thumb/b/b4/Guzma_Golisopod.png/300px-Guzma_Golisopod.png decoding=async width=200 height=113 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></td><td><b><span id=Golisopod></span>Golisopod</b></td></tr><tr readability=29.293581960104><td rowspan=5 align=left width=75% readability=23.774501300954><a href=# title="Golisopod (Pokémon)">Golisopod</a> is Guzma's first known Pokémon.
