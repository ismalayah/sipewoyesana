Even those who don’t regularly follow the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">ACE Family</a> – who have now broken up – may have an idea of some of the controversies that have surrounded Austin and his family over the years.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=484 data-current-count=484 data-injectable=true>Austin has a younger brother named Landon who is also an internet influencer and has traveled a path that is similar to his brother’s – perhaps because he was inspired to acquire some of his older sibling’s fame through similar means. With the two brothers being so public about their lives, we have over the years gotten glimpses at both their parents, Michole and Allen, and what they may be like. But in case you’re curious, here’s what we know about the McBroom parents.</p><h2 id=h-michole-and-allen-mcbroom data-injectable=false><strong>Michole and Allen McBroom</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Design-sem-nome-2024-02-12T150702.416.png><p data-characters=191 data-current-count=491 data-injectable=true>Michole and Allen have been divorced for a while now, Allen having since remarried Erica McBroom. Allen works at a camp for children with mental disabilities and Michole owns a clothing line.</p><p data-characters=190 data-current-count=190 data-injectable=false>Allen has appeared multiple times in the ACE family videos, and Michole a few times herself. Although, like their sons, both parents have been accused of doing things that are not palatable.</p><p data-characters=398 data-current-count=588 data-injectable=true>A couple of years ago, Allen was accused of sexual assault along with his son Austin. The allegations were best covered by Makeup artist Cole Carrigan. He was a friend of one of the victims, and even featured a phone call with her in the video letting her share her version of events. The original video has since been taken down, allegedly for legal reasons, but it has been <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">reuploaded to YouTube</a>.</p><p data-characters=215 data-current-count=215 data-injectable=false>As for Michole, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Shyla Walker, Landon’s ex-girlfriend</a> and the mother of his daughter, she had things to say about her ex-mother-in-law, including that she was looking at her bank account balance without permission.</p><p data-characters=295 data-current-count=510 data-injectable=true>It appears that drama just naturally follows the family wherever they go. But now that the ACE family is no more, it remains to be seen whether the pattern will eventually calm down. For now, with both Landon and Austin’s constant presence online, it doesn’t seem like it will anytime soon.</p><p data-characters=132 data-current-count=132 data-injectable=false>In case you’re not done going into the rabbit hole, you can read more on the reasons <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">why the Internet dislikes Austin McBroom.</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeemsS0e9ahpmaZopp6osHSraCnZZ2Yr7O7zqaqZqiRp7KvwNJo</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./mr-3000-2004.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Mr. 3000 movie review &amp;amp; film summary (2004)</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./lipstick-1976.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Lipstick movie review &amp;amp; film summary (1976)</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./annie-macaulay-idibia-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-258311-html.html>Annie Macaulay-Idibia Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biograp</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jjk-chapter-247-leaks.html>Yuji Killed Sukuna?!
