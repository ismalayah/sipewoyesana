The rapper has released two studio albums, including&nbsp; A Written Testimony and Act II: The Patents of Nobility (The Turn).&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=jay-electronica-and-erica-badu-relationship>Jay Electronica and Erica Badu’s relationship</h2><p>Jay Electronica and Erica Badu <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">dated each other for five years</a>. In September 2008, news about Erykah Badu’s pregnancy started doing the rounds after the Grammy Award-winning singer performed at the Austin City Limits festival and wore a figure-hugging smiley-face tee that clearly showed off her growing baby bump.&nbsp;</p><p>As the couple anticipated the arrival of their little one, Jay Electronica documented Erykah’s entire delivery process on Twitter. The rapper updated fans in real-time about Erykah’s contractions.&nbsp;</p><p>Likewise, he informed fans that their midwife was running a little late. Soon after, Jay announced that Erykah’s water had broken, and 20 minutes later, he announced the arrival of their daughter, Mars Merkaba Thedford.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebcritics.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Jay-Electronica-and-Erica-Badu-with-their-daughter-Mars.jpg><p>Even though Erykah Badu and Jay Electronica are no longer together, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the former couple continues to be on friendly terms</a> and tries their best to be great co-parents to their daughter, Mars.

However, she has two half-siblings from her mother’s previous relationships.&nbsp;</p><p>Erykah Badu, who dated André 3000 of OutKast in 1995, had her first child with the rapper on November 18, 1997. Their son Seven Sirius Benjamin leads a private life away from the media spotlight.&nbsp;</p><p>Mars Merkaba’s half-sister Puma Sabti Curry was born on July 5, 2004. Erykah Badu shares Puma with Texas-based rapper The D.O.C.</p><p>Puma is <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">an up-and-coming model</a>.

The&nbsp;“Bag Lady” singer once revealed on social media that all her children, including Mars Merkaba, are homeschooled.&nbsp;</p><p>Likewise, she said in a 2009 interview with People magazine,</p><p>“All my children have been thru Badu school.

When the Grammy Awards-nominated rapper shared the video on his Instagram, Badu commented,</p><p>“Take this down. I have had a restraining order on this man. @jayelectronica and I are not even supposed to be in the same place.”&nbsp;</p><p>Badu’s comment came as a shock to fans, and they couldn’t believe that the relationship between <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the once madly in love couple had become</a> so bitter at a point that Badu had to file a restraining order against Jay.&nbsp;</p><p>Jay Electronica responded to Erica Badu’s comment and wrote, “Don’t make me come back out there.” Despite their awkward exchange, fans believed that the couple had let bygones be bygones and were on much better terms with each other.&nbsp;</p><p>However, just a year later, Jay Electronica made controversial statements about Erykah Badu during an Instagram live with his former partner. The rapper said,</p><p>If Erykah been flirting with any of you n*ggas in your DM, it’s all coming to a cease today.”</p><p>Likewise, he added,</p><p>“Erykah belongs to me. She’s my daughter… Fix your face don’t play with me on this Instagram with these people. She’s my first daughter, she’s my wife, she’s my baby mama, she’s my spiritual healer, and she’s my porn star. So all you n*ggas in this DM, get the f*ck out the DMs or you gonna have to deal with me.”</p><p>Many of their fans attending the Instagram live expressed their displeasure about Jay Electronica’s possessive nature. However, Erykah quickly gave Electronica a befitting reply and said,</p><p>“I just called you ’bout some child support.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=mars-merkaba-thedford-net-worth-and-lifestyle>Mars Merkaba Thedford Net Worth</h2><p>Since Mars Merkaba Thedford is just 14 years old, she is yet to start a career of her own and make a living.
