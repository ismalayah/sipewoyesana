Since his turn on Santa Clara Diet, he’s been hot property, appearing <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">in MCU films</a> and indie darlings, while also managing to keep a fairly low profile in terms of gossip pages. If you’re a fan of some of his shows and movie appearances, and want to know what else he’s been in, then read ahead for our guide to the best Skyler Gisondo movies and TV shows.</p>Recommended Videos<h2 data-injectable=false>1. Vacation</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=540 data-current-count=840 data-injectable=true>This final installation of the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Vacation series doesn’t quite have the magic of the National Lampoon classics</a>, but Gisondo is a bright spot as the loser teen who gets bullied by his younger brother but eventually (kind of) gets the girl. Although his storyline is secondary to the main plot (and just as cliche) he makes the film a lot more engaging, and you end up really rooting for him. Despite a good cast (Ed Helms, Christina Applegate) the rest of the movie really does fall flat, but at least it’s under a hundred minutes.</p><h2 id=h-2-hard-sell data-injectable=false>2. Hard Sell</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=968 data-current-count=1268 data-injectable=true>This high school comedy drama isn’t the biggest hit that Gisondo has ever been in, but it really is a bit of an underrated watch, and a huge component of that is his excellent performance in the role of Hardy. Hardy’s a poor senior at an affluent private school, surrounded by the not-so-nice kids of the rich and famous. His mother struggles with mental illness, and her only joy is their family dog, Walter. When the dog gets sick and needs an expensive surgery, a desperate Hardy struggles to come up with a money-making scheme until a wayward, beautiful socialite named Bo comes into his life. They soon begin scamming his classmates, but quickly realize there’s more to life than swindling rich kids as Hardy struggles with his family issues and Bo’s past comes back to haunt her. Gisondo traverses the line between funny and sweet very well, and the interesting (albeit unrealistic premise) allows him to really show off his acting chops.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>3. Time Freak</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=843 data-current-count=1143 data-injectable=true>A sci-fi comedy with plenty of dramatic elements, this 2018 time travel film isn’t the best watch but certainly has some sparkling performances, especially from Gisondo. He plays Evan, the best friend to recently dumped physics genius Stillman (<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Sex Education star Asa Butterfield</a>), who builds a machine to take him back in time so he can make sure his girlfriend doesn’t break up with him. As Stillman becomes more obsessed with making everything in their lives perfect, Evan tries to reason with his friend, but ultimately joins him on his constant missions back in time before becoming addicted to using the machine himself. It’s undoubtedly a weird script, but Gisondo and his cast make up for the convoluted nature of the plot with some standout performances, blending a range of emotions to make it all seem believable.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>4. Booksmart</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=725 data-current-count=1025 data-injectable=true>Gisondo doesn’t have the biggest part in<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> Olivia Wilde’s directorial debut</a>, but he certainly shines as Jared, the rich kid and right-guy-all-along, in this high school comedy. Beanie Feldstein and Kaitlyn Dever star as Molly and Amy respectively, two high-achieving best friends who get to the end of their time at school and wish they had spent more time having fun. They decide to go to a huge party one of their classmates is throwing, utilizing the help of the wealthy Jared, who has a crush on Molly. Between then and a tearful goodbye at the airport, there’s some accidental use of hallucenogenics, a big argument at a rager, and a scene with a serial killer – so plenty to keep you entertained.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>5. Wet Hot American Summer: Ten Years Later</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=600 data-current-count=900 data-injectable=true>Although he was only in three of the eight episodes in this hilarious sequel to the 2001 satire Wet Hot American Summer, Gisondo killed it as Jeremy, or the “new Andy” as much of the rest of the cast referred to him (the real Andy is played by Paul Rudd, which is always a favorable comparison). This was not a show that took itself too seriously, and it was all the better for it, really leaning into its cult status and general ridiculousness. And, to be honest, it didn’t really need to be anything other than that, given the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">unbelievable power of the comedic talents involved</a>.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>6. Fairfax</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=753 data-current-count=1053 data-injectable=true>This animated Prime Video series shows that Gisondo’s acting talents shine just as brightly when he’s in a voice role. Fairfax is about four middle schoolers trying their hardest to fit in on Fairfax Avenue in L.A, and the adult animation is perfect for fans of the sort of comedies you’d normally find on Adult Swim. It’s also about as bingeable as television gets, which is never a bad thing. Despite the occasional crass humor, the comedy and even emotional arcs are spot on, and Gisondo’s character Dale is a particular fan favorite. The first season is great but the second really steps it up, and most fans are pretty desperate for a third, so with any luck Amazon will greenlight that and give us more Gisondo magic.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>7. Class Rank</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=786 data-current-count=1086 data-injectable=true>Considering his age and baby face, it’s not surprising to find yet another high school comedy in this list, but Class Rank is probably the best of the bunch thanks to its quirky storyline and brilliant performances from Gisondo and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">his co-star Olivia Holt</a>. They play Bernard and Veronica, two intelligent students who attempt to get on the local schoolboard while Bernard slowly realizes he returns Veronica’s feelings for him. It’s cute and funny, and the pair have a great on-screen chemistry that really makes you empathize with both. Although every cast member in this underrated group does a great job of elevating the script, Gisondo is particularly captivating in the lead, managing to maintain the aloofness of freaky intelligence while still being charming.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>8. The Righteous Gemstones</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=711 data-current-count=1011 data-injectable=true>This HBO dark crime comedy series is excellent in so many ways, but it really is the phenomenal acting by Gisondo and his fellow cast members that makes it (<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">although even the best pros fluff it sometimes</a>). Gisondo plays Gideon, the grandson of the Gemstone patriarch, a scammer televangelist and megachurch owner. Gideon left the family business of swindling religious folks out of their hard earned wealth to try and make it as a stunt actor in L.A – something his father (Danny McBride, also the show creator) despises. The series is a great satirical take on Christian Capitalism, or “Muscular Christianity” as it’s sometimes deemed, and will make you think as well as make you laugh.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>9. Licorice Pizza</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=563 data-current-count=863 data-injectable=true>Despite making very little at the box office, this indie darling went on to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">secure multiple Oscar nominations</a>, as well as make plenty of top-of-the-year lists. The film has a loose and winding plot, following a young couple’s burgeoning relationship. Gisondo plays a love interest of the female lead (Alana Haim) who’s eventually kicked out of the picture. Although his part is relatively brief in the grand scheme of the film, he’s excellent as the love rival, and one of the many reasons this movie was regarded so highly the year it came out.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>10. Santa Clara Diet</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=740 data-current-count=1040 data-injectable=false>Yet another victim of Netflix’s fetish for cancelling beloved shows before they’re wrapped up, Santa Clara Diet is a hilariously dark supernatural comedy, chock full of great writing, striking set design, and some incredible acting performances – including from Gisondo. The show stars Drew Barrymore as Sheila, a real estate agent who undergoes a transformation into being undead and begins craving human meat. Gisondo is Eric, her neighbour and the step-son of one of Sheila’s victims. He plays the role perfectly, and was a big part in why the third (and last) season of the show currently has a 100% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. It’s just a shame we won’t get to see him back in the part any time soon.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJoq6GdXZeytMCMrKKypJWneqi10qilnaddory3tcSsZJqmlGLBt3nSoaawq18%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./walking-tall-2004.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Walking Tall movie review &amp;amp; film summary (2004)</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./mandjtv.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>MandJTV- Bio, Age, Height, Girlfriend, Dating, Net Worth</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./annie-macaulay-idibia-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-258311-html.html>Annie Macaulay-Idibia Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biograp</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jjk-chapter-247-leaks.html>Yuji Killed Sukuna?!
