She has even made a few appearances on SNL.</p><p>However, despite her link to such a famous person, Amy is known to stay out of the spotlight. When she posts on social media, it is often about her children.&nbsp;On March 4, 2022, Amy melted hearts when she took to social media to honor her son on National Son’s Day.&nbsp;</p><p>She wrote on Instagram: “Happy National Son’s Day! I couldn’t be more proud of the man you are today! Love you more.”&nbsp;Amy has repeatedly proven that she is her son’s biggest supporter and is proud of his work.</p><p>Another proof of Amy’s love for her son is how religiously she keeps up with the happenings in his life.

Scott was a firefighter who died during the 9/11 tragedy, and his death <a href=#>shook</a> the family.&nbsp;</p><p>Scott attended the College of Staten Island, where he graduated with a bachelor’s degree in history. He was very athletic and was known to play on the basketball team in college.&nbsp;</p><p>He even became captain during his senior year. Despite studying history, Scott became a firefighter on January 16, 1994, and that’s what he did until his demise.&nbsp;Scott reportedly died at 33 while running up the Marriott World Trade Centre hotel stairs on 9/11.</p><p>It was mere minutes before the second Twin Towers collapsed, and his son was only seven then.&nbsp;Amy keeps his memories alive in several ways, especially remembering him on special days like Father’s Day.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=How_Did_Amy_Waters_Davidsons_Husbands_Death_Affect_Their_Son></span>How Did Amy Waters Davidson’s Husband’s Death Affect Their Son?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Pete was very close to his father before he died.

Amy was so supportive of her kids that she even let Pete start stand-up comedy at age 16 because of how sad he was growing up.&nbsp;</p><p>Pete could lean into the relief comedy brought him, but moving past his father’s demise was not easy. Amy believes that her son is just now healing and truly living life.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Amy_Waters_Davidson_Children></span>Amy Waters Davidson Children&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The proud mother has two kids, including Pete Davidson and a daughter named Casey.&nbsp;Casey is currently in her 20s and graduated in 2019 from Marist College.
