First, to pin the blame for the murders on someone else to stay clear of all records and to kill Kate’s father Tom Lockwood, potential opposition to Montrose.</p><p data-characters=224 data-current-count=453 data-injectable=true>To the audience’s shock, it was revealed that the person threatening and blackmailing Joe wasn’t the real Rhys but a figment of Joe’s imagination. The Rhys he was talking to represented his darkest, most inhumane side.</p><p data-characters=423 data-current-count=423 data-injectable=true>Given Joe’s murderous instincts, none of the characters seem to be safe. However, there is one of them who has attracted special attention in the new episodes. This is Joe’s literature student, Nadia (Amy-Leigh Hickman), who, in the first part of the season, was of constant help to Joe in understanding the nitty gritty of a whodunit murder mystery which helped him uncover the secret of the ‘Eat the Rich’ killer.</p><p data-characters=290 data-current-count=290 data-injectable=false>She is Joe’s smartest student who, not unlike him, loves to read. She’s portrayed as an opinionated young woman, a keen observer, and Joe’s confidante in the season’s first half. Unfortunately, the latter led to her downfall towards the end. Let’s shed some light on the same.</p><h2 id=h-what-happens-to-nadia data-injectable=false><strong>What happens to Nadia?</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Nadia-and-Eddie.png><p data-characters=335 data-current-count=335 data-injectable=false>Throughout the show’s run, the audience has been exposed to a definite pattern in Joe’s life, which plays out thusly: Joe meets a woman whom he obsesses over to the eventual end of her death at his hands. In between, there’s one person who is vulnerable and an easy target for imminent trouble and who is ultimately saved by Joe.</p><p data-characters=374 data-current-count=709 data-injectable=true>In season one, it was Joe’s neighbor’s kid, Paco, and in season two, Ellie (Jenna Ortega). In season four, Nadia seems to be stepping into a similar role — that of a harmless companion who’s not a potential romantic interest. Things take an unexpected turn after Joe successfully frames Phoebe’s stalker Dawn (who is diagnosed with Erotomania) for all the murders.</p><p data-characters=402 data-current-count=402 data-injectable=true>While for everyone, the lingering mystery seems to be solved, Nadia remains suspicious. In episode seven, “Good Man, Cruel World,” she admits her doubts about Dawn being the perpetrator considering she is an easy target to frame and after a detailed analysis, she and her boyfriend Edward conclude that the murderer’s keen intelligence to steer clear of the spotlight matches Joe’s profile.</p><p data-characters=381 data-current-count=381 data-injectable=false>Thereafter, she begins to investigate the truth and on frantically searching Joe’s office, finds a key. Tracking Joe’s movements, she discovers that the key belongs to a warehouse next to Joe’s go-to takeout Indian restaurant. After entering the abandoned building, she finds an imprisoned Marienne inside Joe’s glass cage who then revealed every detail about him to Nadia.</p><p data-characters=284 data-current-count=665 data-injectable=true>Together, they hatch a plan to free her. Nadia gives Marienne beta blockers that will allow her to fake her death by slowing her heart rate. Marienne exactly follows the instructions and takes the pills, faking her suicide upon learning from Joe about losing her daughter’s custody.</p><p data-characters=316 data-current-count=316 data-injectable=false>Turns out that Joe was texting Nadia all along. Joe thinking Marienne is dead disposes of her body during which she manages to take the antidote and escapes the scene. While Marienne is out of Joe’s clutches for good, the same isn’t the case with Nadia, who takes it upon herself to dig deeper into Joe’s past.</p><p data-characters=256 data-current-count=572 data-injectable=true>In the process, she learns about Love’s death and somehow draws a connection with Rhys Montrose’s disappearance (who is murdered by Joe in this season). To lay her hands on more clues, she breaks into Joe’s apartment and finds Rhy’s personal items.</p><p data-characters=264 data-current-count=264 data-injectable=false>To secure them as a piece of evidence, she takes pictures and leaves the apartment only to be found and confronted by Joe. While Nadia’s brutal murder at this moment seems to be a possibility, it is not her but her boyfriend Eddie who turns out to be the victim.</p><p data-characters=470 data-current-count=734 data-injectable=true>He forcefully hands her the knife, deletes the photos of Rhys’ objects from her phone, and informs her of his plans to frame her for Rhys’s and Eddie’s murders by saying “There’s going to be a box found in your bedroom by the police. Rhys Montrose’s things, anonymous tipster. You realized it was Eddie. That’s why you killed him.” Her arrest and imprisonment happen off-screen while Joe emerges clean and victorious from all the wrongdoings.</p><h2 id=h-will-nadia-return-in-season-five data-injectable=false><strong>Will Nadia return in season five?</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Feature-image-of-Nadia-from-You.png><p data-characters=290 data-current-count=590 data-injectable=true>It is not confirmed whether the show will be renewed for a fifth season, but the fans are still holding out hope. In case that happens, there will be endless speculations about what fate has in store for various characters or most importantly, if any character from season four will return.</p><p data-characters=228 data-current-count=228 data-injectable=false>One of the theories will certainly be about Nadia who, as per Joe in the final episode, did not reveal anything in her defense following her arrest. We also got a glimpse of Marienne reading about Joe’s phenomenal recognition.</p><p data-characters=169 data-current-count=397 data-injectable=false>Now the question remains, Will Nadia return in season five? If she does, will she take revenge? Will she and Marienne collaborate to finally end Joe’s reign of terror?</p><p data-characters=56 data-current-count=453 data-injectable=true>Guess we would have to wait for a long time to find out.</p><p data-characters=51 data-current-count=51 data-injectable=false>You season four is currently streaming on Netflix.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y4tMCtZKGZoKWyr7%2BMraZmppGZtqJ5yKdksqelYsCmrdKopWZsXaWus8CMa2Y%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./guillermo-del-toro-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-555079-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Guillermo del Toro Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./how-to-get-the-red-dress-filter-on-tiktok.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>How to get the red dress filter on TikTok</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./annie-macaulay-idibia-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-258311-html.html>Annie Macaulay-Idibia Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biograp</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jjk-chapter-247-leaks.html>Yuji Killed Sukuna?!
