He weighs approximately 80 kg. He has lovely warm black eyes and Black locks. There is no information on his chest-waist-hip measurements, dress size, shoe size, biceps, etc.</span></p><h2>Career</h2><ul><li>The native of Detroit has been a hockey coach for more than 20 years. He most certainly made a substantial income from his coaching career. Similarly, Jeff Blashill must also have a sizable net worth.</li><li>At his alma institution, Blashill began his coaching career in 1999 as an assistant coach for the Ferris State Bulldogs in NCAA hockey. Later, in 2002, he joined Miami University as a Miami RedHawks assistant coach. Then, in 2008, he was appointed head coach and general manager of the Tier I junior ice hockey club in the USHL known as the Indiana Ice. In 2010, the former hockey player at Western Michigan University was named head coach of the Western Michigan Broncos.</li><li>After that, in 2011, Blashill joined the Detroit Red Wings coaching staff as an assistant, and a year later, he took the head coaching role with the Grand Rapids Griffins, the Red Wings AHL affiliate. In 2014, he renewed his three-year deal with the Red Wings organization, and a year later, he was appointed the team’s head coach.</li><li>In April 2019, the Red Wings said they had hired the coach, who was born in 1973, to a two-year contract. In 2021, he agreed to renew his contract with the Red Wings. Sadly, on April 30, 2022, he was fired by the Wings. In July 2022, the Tampa Bay Lightning hired the athlete as their new assistant coach as a result.</li></ul><h2><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Blashill-2-1.webp alt width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></h2><h2>Jeff Blashill ’s Net Worth</h2><p>Jeff Blashill received annual compensation of $800,000 from CapFriendly, totaling $3,200,000 during his first four seasons as the Red Wings head coach. He must thus have gotten a raise when his contract was extended for the following seasons.</p><p>Additionally, according to The Athletic, senior assistant coaches with a couple of head coaching stints make between $500,000 and $700,000. The FSU grad’s salary as the assistant coach of the Lightning must also be considered given that he led the Detriot for seven years. Therefore, Jeff Blashill must have a sizable net worth.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Blashill-3-1.jpg alt width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><h2>Jeff Blashill Wife, Marriage, Children</h2><p>The native of Detroit is a devoted husband to his girlfriend, Erica Blashill. The latter, also known as Erica William Blashill, is a businesswoman and the owner of Plaid Spirit and LEO Marketing. While attending Ferris State University, the two fell in love. Jeff Blashill’s wife complimented his earnestness, determination, sense of humor, and terrific personality in an interview with NHL.</p><p>In addition to being happily married, Jeff and his wife, Erica, have welcomed three children. They have devoted parents to Josie Blashill, their little daughter, and their two sons, Teddy and Owen Blashill. Teddy Blashill, Jeff Blashill’s kid born on February 3, 2006, enjoys playing golf and hockey. Josie, however, is Jeff Blashill’s second child and his daughter. Last but not least, Owen is three years Josie’s junior and is named after his great-grandfather. Little information about the children has been made available since they are all so young. But oddly, Erica’s lustrous light brunette hair has been passed down to all of the little ones.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Blashill-4-1.webp alt width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><h2>Interesting Facts</h2><ul><li>He participated in both junior and collegiate hockey.</li><li>During his seven-year tenure with the Detroit Red Wings, Jeff posted 204-261-72.</li><li>Previously, Blashill held positions as the head coach of the Indiana Ice, the head coach and general manager of the Grand Rapids Griffins of the American Hockey League (AHL), an assistant coach for the Red Wings, the head coach of the Western Michigan University ice hockey team, and an assistant coach at both Ferris State University and Miami University.</li></ul><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGihnp6WYq%2BtrdKhoKWkXw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./shannade-clermont-bio-wiki-age-family-boyfriend-tv-shows-modeling-and-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Shannade Clermont Bio, Wiki, Age, Family, Boyfriend, TV Shows, Modeling and Net Worth</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./its-hard-to-see-the-point-of-spike-tvs-the-mist.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Its Hard to See the Point of Spike TVs The Mist | TV/Streaming</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./annie-macaulay-idibia-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-258311-html.html>Annie Macaulay-Idibia Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biograp</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jjk-chapter-247-leaks.html>Yuji Killed Sukuna?!
