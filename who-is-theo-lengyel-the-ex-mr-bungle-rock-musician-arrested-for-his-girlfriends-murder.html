Once reported missing, her car was found at Lengyel’s home, and he was declared a person of interest in the case. Reportedly, Lengyel <a href=#>refused to cooperate with the investigation</a>, and around that same time, he made an unexplained car trip to Portland, Oregon, the <a href=#>El Cerrito Police Department</a> said.</p><p data-characters=379 data-current-count=379 data-injectable=false>Herrmann’s remains were later found in Tilden Regional Park in Berkeley, California, about 80 miles away from Santa Cruz. Once in custody, Lengyel was booked into the Santa Cruz County jail on first-degree murder charges.
