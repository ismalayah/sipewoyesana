What he is looking at is fuzzy, but we will learn that it is a poster for a school, featuring his daughter, the star student Miloni (<a href=#>Sanya Malhotra</a>). She is studying for an accounting degree.</p><p>Miloni and Rafi meet when she visits the Gateway and agrees to let him take her picture. She is called away by her family before he can put it in an envelope for her.</p><p>He hears (amusingly, over and over again from a whole series of people) that his grandmother has stopped taking her medicine until he makes some progress on getting married. So he impulsively sends her a photograph of Miloni as proof that he is seeing someone. Unfortunately, this is such exciting news that his grandmother (Farrukh Jaffar) decides to come see the girl for herself. He then&nbsp;has to try to find Miloni and persuade her to pretend to be the girl he told his grandmother he was dating.</p><p>At least that is what we infer. We never see that conversation. The charm of this film, which may take some getting used to for those accustomed to spell-it-out storytelling, is that it takes place in those quieter liminal moments, and it is just right for this story's delicacy. So are the exquisitely framed shots and the loving portrayal of the city of Mumbai.&nbsp;</p><p>Siddiqui and Malhotra are well suited to the gentle tone of the film, both quietly expressive in scenes where everything is conveyed through posture and eyes. There is a fairy tale quality to the story. In a city of more than 18 million people, Rafi is able to find Miloni (with some help from that billboard picture). Later in the film, he&nbsp;even gets some supernatural advice.&nbsp;Even Rafi’s crowded sleeping quarters are lit to seem almost magical.<br></p><p>After all, this is a movie set in the present day where an old-fashioned paper photograph,&nbsp;ejected while you wait from a portable printer, has enormous power. Miloni says that she saw someone who looks happier and prettier than she has ever been in her photograph. Can it be because that's how Rafi sees her? Or is it a glimpse of a life she never dared to imagine for herself?</p><p>We hear a casual reference at a family dinner to a time when Miloni wanted to be an actress, before her family pushed her to study accounting. As herself, she is so introverted and unsure that she cannot even tell Rafi or her mother what color she likes. But pretending to be the girl he wrote about, she can come up with a dramatic backstory for the character she is playing. And seeing herself differently, in the photograph and in the persona she creates for Rafi’s grandmother, inspires her to think about other lives and envision a different one for herself. She asks her family’s maid about life on a farm. She can tell Rafi about missing the cola she used to share with her grandfather.</p><p>This is a film that ends with the two characters walking out of a movie theater, with one of them saying, “The stories are all the same in movies these days.”&nbsp;It may be that the stories in movies are all the same. But it can be lovely when a movie like this one finds a different way to tell them.<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46pn6isn5y%2ForzHZmlpaWk%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./rina-lipa-dua-lipas-sister-bio-wiki-age-birthday-height-parents-siblings-sister-school-boyfriend-net-worth-and-wikipedia.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Rina Lipa (Dua Lipas Sister) Bio, Wiki, Age, Birthday, Height, Parents, Siblings, Sister, School,</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./one-of-steven-seagals-best-reviewed-movies-that-still-sucks-wakes-up-on-netflix.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>One of Steven Seagals best-reviewed movies (that still sucks) wakes up on Netflix</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./annie-macaulay-idibia-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-258311-html.html>Annie Macaulay-Idibia Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biograp</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jjk-chapter-247-leaks.html>Yuji Killed Sukuna?!
