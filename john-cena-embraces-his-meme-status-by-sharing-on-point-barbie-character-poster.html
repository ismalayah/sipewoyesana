Okay, so that is not technically true, but it is a joke that has been following the wrestler-turned-actor for some time now. Cena has leaned into this now-famous meme time and time again and has done so once more, now creating his own <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Barbie</a></strong> poster.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=551 data-current-count=551 data-injectable=true>The whole ‘invisible’ joke started off while Cena was still wrestling, it was actually Cena himself that set the whole thing in motion as part of his wrestling character’s schtick. Wrestling is, of course, another form of acting, and wrestlers often come up with characters, personalities, moves, and sayings for audiences to latch onto. Some of the more memorable ones include Dwayne ‘The Rock’ Johnson’s “Can you smell what the Rock is cooking?” and The Undertaker’s “Rest in Peace.”</p><p data-characters=329 data-current-count=329 data-injectable=false>In the wake of the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">new Barbie Selfie Generator</a>, a great marketing trick from the upcoming movie that allows anyone to insert themselves into the poster, Cena has once again embraced his incorporeal ability. The action star posted the image to his Instagram account with the poster caption, “This Barbie is John Cena.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=629 data-injectable=true><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by John Cena (@johncena)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=411 data-current-count=411 data-injectable=true>It’s stunts like this that make Cena one of the most well-loved action stars working right now. Of course, looking at him, he looks built to be an action star, but what has surprised everyone over the years is his comedic capability. The actor first proved he was capable of comedic greatness in the 2015 Amy Schumer film Trainwreck where he played the dopey and surprisingly soft and romantic boyfriend.</p><p data-characters=458 data-current-count=458 data-injectable=true>He has continued to shine on screen, most recently in his DC endeavors alongside director James Gunn in Suicide Squad and his own spin-off series, Peacemaker. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">It was just recently made public that Cena does have a role</a> in the Barbie movie after eagle-eyed fans spotted his name in the recent trailer. It is not certain what role the star will play in the movie as we have had no information of his involvement other than his name appearing in the cast list.</p><p data-characters=410 data-current-count=410 data-injectable=false>Cena does not have an official character poster for the movie, so all we can do is speculate as to what role he may play. He could be one of the many Kens that are all over the Barbie world, but we think it would be quite cool if he could come in as another famous toy in the form of G.I Joe. At this moment though we couldn’t say, let’s hope that he becomes a little more visible as time goes by.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2S3sLTNZpqeppFisq6u0Zqanqtdnba0ecyepJ5lo6mutcHSZpmyZaOdrrO1zaBkqKZdpbyqutNmmZqqkp6ybq%2FHmqmam6Sav268zqyrnqpf</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./kumail-nanjiani.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Kumail Nanjiani movie reviews &amp;amp; film summaries</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./jaren-lewison-height.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Jaren Lewison Height How Tall Is Jaren Lewison?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./annie-macaulay-idibia-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-258311-html.html>Annie Macaulay-Idibia Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biograp</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jjk-chapter-247-leaks.html>Yuji Killed Sukuna?!
